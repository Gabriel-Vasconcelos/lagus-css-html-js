# Lagus CSS/HTML/JS Test

## Description

This test was built to assess early stage web developers. It is considered by me that developers that can finish this test with a satisfatory result are eligible to resolve simple HTML/CSS tasks for real life problems using NextJS Applications.

The objective is to style the following FIGMA wires: https://www.figma.com/file/tMlYqXVlvvp6gAuxcqFAI5/lagus-test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=Rvwf8776IOpPYVtg-1.

It will be considered a successful implementation if all components are pixel perfect and the page is fully responsive. Both mobile and desktop wires are in the Figma file with all font styles, element spacings and image proportions. There is also an example of the heder button hover effect.

Reach out the one who sent you this test in case you have any questions. I encourage you to do so, since strong communication is the key for a successful delivery.

## Bonus

In the header button, implement a simple behavior of counting how many times the button was clicked.

# NextJS README

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
